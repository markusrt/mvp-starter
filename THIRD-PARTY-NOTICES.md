# Third-party notices

The skills `grilling`, `prototype`, `pr`, `to-questionnaire` and `wait-what` under `.claude/skills/` are vendored from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) at commit `4ae2317` (`4ae2317ddb22b046e26455e4f9c9b3aaaf62212d`), licensed under the MIT License (Copyright (c) 2026 Matt Pocock). Each vendored `SKILL.md` carries a `metadata.source` link to the exact file in that commit. The `pr` skill additionally credits Dex Horthy's `show-me` skill (Humanlayer); see `.claude/skills/pr/CREDITS.md`.

They were adapted for this template as follows (the `agents/openai.yaml` file was dropped from every skill, and a `metadata` block with source, license and vendoring date was added to every `SKILL.md`):

- `grilling` — copied unchanged.
- `prototype` — `UI.md` dropped and the SKILL.md rewritten to describe only the LOGIC branch: a single self-contained HTML file written to the scratchpad/temp directory and offered to the owner, kept on a `prototype/<name>` branch only if the owner says so; references to an issue tracker removed; `LOGIC.md` adjusted accordingly (UI.md pointer removed, capture step reworded).
- `pr` — `CREDITS.md` kept.
- `to-questionnaire` — copied unchanged.
- `pr` — the reference to `GLOSSARY.md` replaced by the vocabulary of the active spec and the product's own words.
- `wait-what` — the reference to `GLOSSARY.md` / `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` replaced by the vocabulary of the active spec (`specs/NNN-*/spec.md`) and the product's own words.
